// Implement the following function to calculate the current balance of a bank savings account at the end of numMonths (a specific number of months).
// balance(openingSum, interestRate, taxFreeLimit, taxRate, numMonths)

// The calculation must reflect the following assumptions:
// ● openingSum is the initial account balance.
// ● Every month, the monthly interest is calculated as interestRate percent of the account balance available at the beginning of each month.
// ● Every month, the monthly tax is calculated as taxRate percent of (account balance - taxFreeLimit) if the account balance is greater than the allowed taxFreeLimit. Otherwise, the monthly tax is 0.
// ● At the end of each month, the balance is updated by adding the monthly interest and subtracting the monthly tax.

// Example outputs:
// balance(10000, 1, 20000, 1, 2) #must be approximately 10201
// balance(25000, 2, 20000, 1, 2) #must be approximately 25904.5
// balance(19800, 2, 20000, 1, 2) #must be approximately 20597.96

let balance = (openingSum, interestRate, taxFreeLimit, taxRate, numMonths) => {
  while (numMonths !== 0) {
    let monthlyInterest = (openingSum * interestRate) / 100;
    let monthlyTax = 0;
    if (openingSum > taxFreeLimit) {
      monthlyTax = ((openingSum - taxFreeLimit) * taxRate) / 100;
    }
    openingSum = openingSum + monthlyInterest - monthlyTax;
    numMonths--;
  }

  return openingSum;
};
